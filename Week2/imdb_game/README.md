<b>IMDB GAME</b>

This program takes in user input via a search bar for movies. When the search is submitted,
the program searches the IMDB database for the first ten movies matching the input. Those
ten movies are then shown on the next page with their corresponding movie posters.

The user is then asked to pick the correct movie based on their assumption of the answer
to the given question. Each movie poster is clickable, giving a prompt message whether
their selection is correct or incorrect. The correct movie is always picked at random
by the program.
