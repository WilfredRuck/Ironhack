	<p style="color:red;">Key elements to look for & think about while testing...<p>
	
	<li>
		Learnability: How easy is it for you to learn to perform the task? For more complicated tasks, are there help features such as hints?
	</li>
		<br>
	<li>
		Intuitiveness: How obvious and easy is the task to accomplish?
	</li>
		<br>	
	<li>
		Memorability: How easy is the task to repeat?
	</li>
		<br>
	<li>
		Affordance: Are interactive elements (such as buttons, links and input text boxes) related to the accomplishment of a task? Is the page that you are brought to expected? If not, what did you expect to be shown?
	</li>
		<br>
	<li>
		And most importantly, give feedback and let me know where I can improve and what you would like to see within the site.
	</li>
